I am happy to announce RubyStarters at the RubyHabits [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de/RubyHabits/events/226205940/) today, Oktober 28th 2015, 18:30 at
[Sektor5](http://www.sektor5.at/), Siebenbrunnengasse 44, 1050 Wien.
(I now, that announcemant comes waaay too late.)

To form RubyHabits it is needed to overcome the hurdles you are confronted with when starting with programming Ruby.
We try to make mastering these easy and awesome.

Up to now it is not much more than an idea. Real people (and lots of real work :) ) is needed to make the goals come true.
If you are interested and around, join in at the RubyHabits mentioned above.

We created two repos at our [RubyHabits Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de/RubyHabits/events/226647668/) today:

One repo collects all [Questions and Answers](https://github.com/RubyStarters/QandA/issues). Please put your questions there at well!

The second repo we use to collect on ideas for Tutorials, Cheat Sheets and other kinds of instructions. Please contribute to the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/RubyStarters/Ideas/wiki) there.
